<p align="center"><h3><b>Executive Summary</b></h3></p>

<p>Hybrid-casual is the <a href="https://unity.com/blog/the-shift-from-hyper-to-hybrid-games-and-why-it-matters-for-everyone">new</a> hyper-casual. Given <a href="https://youtu.be/bNpx7gpSqbY?t=209">timing</a> is everything there is no time to waste. Let's try putting....JustPutting(<a href="https://jnnilson.github.io/JustPutting/">Proof of Concept</a>)...more details availabe in <a href="https://github.com/jnnilson/jnnilson/blob/main/PitchDeck.pdf">Pitch Deck</a></p>
  
<p><b>Revenue</b>: Ad Sales, In App Purchases</p>

<p><b>Secret Sauce</b>: Think Blockchain Digital Assets. When player gets bored they can buy more greens including <i>copies of real ones</i> from anywhere in the world, the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/the-national-map-data-delivery/gis-data-download">elevation data</a> about which is often <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/are-there-any-costs-or-restrictions-usage-data-downloaded-national-map">freely available</a>. There are >300,000 putting greens in the world, adding their digital copy to the Blockchain is a perfect fit for the technology.</p>

<p><b>Proposal</b>: Build another Proof of Concept using Web3 smart contracts to let players build new greens in the game itself. Greens are now digital assets and player can earn money selling them to other players via in app purchases. JustPutting is really two games: 1) Putting 2) Building Greens in which the players can grow the game themselves without any need for further development, a potentially lucrative <b>Economy of Scale</b>.</p>

<p><h3><b>Context</b></h3></p>

<p>How did I get here? In September of 2024 I saw mobile app developer JindoBlu generate over $500,000 per day in <a href="https://youtu.be/q9groW1mOnY" target="_blank">ad revenue</a> for their Offline Games - No Wifi app which went live <a href="https://app.sensortower.com/android/publisher/jindoblu/JindoBlu">a year earlier</a>. What's truly remarkable is JindoBlu did this amid record layoffs in the Video Game industry where big budget studios are losing lots of money. The conclusion seems obvious, people want simpler games.</p>

<p>Yet when I tried JindoBlu apps I got bored. They were <b>too simple</b>, their <a href="https://youtu.be/B1PZZviPYgY">golf app</a> was a perfect example. So I tried the top five Golf Apps everyone's heard of. <b><i>They</i></b> were too busy and complex, I uninstalled all of them after 10 minutes. So I thought what could fill the void. I came up with practice putting and wrote a very simple, one hole, <b><a href="https://jnnilson.github.io/JustPutting/">Proof of Concept</a></b> to show what such a game would look like. Currently no mobile Golf App let's you just practice putting.</p>  

<p> I did a little research and discovered many people have discovered the "<a href="https://unity.com/blog/the-shift-from-hyper-to-hybrid-games-and-why-it-matters-for-everyone">void</a>" in mobile games. Intrigued at discovering an entirely new mobile gaming sector is forming, I stepped back and saw the potential of a <b>larger business making an entire suite of hybrid-casual games</b>. I came up with the business name <b>JustRelaxing</b>. So if you're an Angle Investor or VC and want to get ahead of the curve feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-nilson-1978ab9/">LinkedIn</a>.

<p><h3>Credibility</h3></p>

<p>In 2014 I wrote a hyper-casual "Sports Motion Editor" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPMEMKzQ2cI&list=PLzv9Ec4NAYmEBrqGg8LMDTIR4nKOnzU6Y&index=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game</a> but <i>gave up on it</i> because it was too hyper-casual. Imagine my surprise when it became a valid market segment. That's part of the reason I'm pitching this new idea. <i>I was right.</i> Why aren't I pitching the motion editor idea? Because I doubted myself so much I deleted the code a few years ago to save space on Google drive. All I have left are the videos and of course the knowledge of how I wrote it. It could easily be re-written, I'm just going with an even simpler idea because that's the name of the game now, less is more. That being said the idea has huge potential, like practice putting, no one does it. Unlike practice putting which only applies to golf, the motion editor code could be transferred to any human movement.</p>
