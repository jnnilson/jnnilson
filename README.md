<p align="center"><h3><b>Executive Summary</b></h3></p>
<p>Hybrid-casual is the new hyper-casual. Should I wait another year or seek funding <a href="https://youtu.be/bNpx7gpSqbY?t=209">right now</a>?</p>

<p><h3><b>Context</b></h3></p>

<p>How did I get here? In September of 2024 I saw mobile app developer JindoBlu generate over $500,000 per day in <a href="https://youtu.be/q9groW1mOnY" target="_blank">revenue</a> for their Offline Games - No Wifi app which went live <a href="https://app.sensortower.com/android/publisher/jindoblu/JindoBlu">a year earlier</a>. What's truly remarkable is JindoBlu did this amid record layoffs in the Video Game industry where big budget studios are losing lots of money. The conclusion seems obvious, people want simpler games.</p>

<p>Yet when I tried JindoBlu apps I got bored. They were <b>too</b> simple. So I thought of what game I could make that has more gameplay, but still relatively simple and relaxing. I came up with practice putting and wrote a very simple, one hole, <b><a href="https://jnnilson.github.io/JustPutting/">Proof of Concept</a></b> to show what such a game would look like. Currently no mobile Golf App let's you just practice putting, there's either Mini-Golf which isn't really putting or complete golf simulators like Golden Tee which only let you putt while you're on a green during a round of golf.</p>  

<p>Intrigued at seeing casual games go mainstream, I stepped back and saw the potential of a <b>larger business making an entire suite of hybrid-casual games</b>. I came up with the business name <b>JustRelaxing</b>. So if you're an Angle Investor or VC and want to get ahead of the curve feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-nilson-1978ab9/">LinkedIn</a>. I have over 20 years of experience in the software industry and can deliver great software fast.</p>

<p><h3>Credibility</h3></p>

<p>In 2014 I wrote a hyper-casual "Sports Motion Editor" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPMEMKzQ2cI&list=PLzv9Ec4NAYmEBrqGg8LMDTIR4nKOnzU6Y&index=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game</a> but <i>gave up on it</i> because it was too hyper-casual. Imagine my surprise when it became a valid market segment. That's part of the reason I'm pitching this new idea. <i>I was right.</i> Why aren't I pitching the motion editor idea? Because I doubted myself so much I deleted the code a few years ago to save space on Google drive. All I have left are the videos and of course the knowledge of how I wrote it. It could easily be re-written, I'm just going with an even simpler idea because that's the name of the game now, less is more. That being said the idea has huge potential, like practice putting, no one does it. Unlike practice putting which only applies to golf, the motion editor code could be transferred to any human movement.</p>
