<p><h3><b>Context</b></h3></p>

<p>How did I get here? In September of 2024 I saw mobile app developer JindoBlu generate over $500,000 per day in <a href="https://youtu.be/q9groW1mOnY" target="_blank">revenue</a> for their Offline Games - No Wifi app which went live <a href="https://app.sensortower.com/android/publisher/jindoblu/JindoBlu">a year earlier</a>. What's truly remarkable is JindoBlu did this amid record layoffs in the Video Game industry where big budget studios are losing lots of money. The conclusion seems obvious, people want simpler games.</p>

<p>So I thought of what game I could make that's simple, relaxing and no one has done before with an eye on starting an entire company building game for this new sector. I came up with practice putting and wrote a very simple, one hole, <b><a href="https://jnnilson.github.io/JustPutting/">Proof of Concept</a></b> to show what such a game would look like. It's totally unique and never been done before as no mobile Golf App let's you just practice putting, there's either Mini-Golf or complete golf simulators like Golden Tee which don't let you practice.</p>  

<p>I've done game programming before. I wrote a hyper-casual "Sports Motion Editor" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPMEMKzQ2cI&list=PLzv9Ec4NAYmEBrqGg8LMDTIR4nKOnzU6Y&index=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game</a> in 2014 but <i>gave up on it</i> because it was too hyper-casual. I didn't provide any videos of the motion editing process because they're the secret sauce behind the idea but the process is, for lack of a better term, addictive.</p>

<p>Intrigued at seeing casual games go mainstream, I stepped back and saw the potential of a larger business making an entire suite of hybrid-casual games. I came up with the business name <b>JustRelaxing</b> for the hybrid-casual, anti-stress mobile game sector which arguably is about to take off.
